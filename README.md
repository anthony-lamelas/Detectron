# Detectron - AI Face Detector

A web application that uses deep learning to detect AI-generated face images. This project leverages React, Node.js, and TensorFlow.js to create a model that can distinguish between real human faces and those generated by AI.

## Overview

In the age of deepfakes and AI-generated content, being able to distinguish between real and artificial images is becoming increasingly important. Detectron serves as a tool to identify AI-generated face images with high accuracy.

## Features

- **AI Detection**: Upload an image to determine if a face is real or AI-generated
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get immediate results through the web interface
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize confidence scores and detection metrics
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any device with a modern web browser

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI for responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js for in-browser ML inference
- **Data Processing**: Python scripts for dataset preparation

## Dataset

This project uses the "Real vs AI Generated Faces Dataset" from Kaggle:

[Real vs AI Generated Faces Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/philosopher0808/real-vs-ai-generated-faces-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The dataset contains labeled images of real human faces (class 0) and AI-generated faces (class 1).

```
